# CPU Information Leak Protection #

TCP Initial Sequence Numbers Randomization to prevent TCP ISN based CPU
Information Leaks.

The Linux kernel has a side-channel information leak bug.
It is leaked in any outgoing traffic.
This can allow side-channel attacks because sensitive information about
a system's CPU activity is leaked.

It may prove very dangerous for long-running cryptographic operations. [A]

Research has demonstrated that it can be used for de-anonymization of
location-hidden services. [1]

Clock skew,

- is leaked through TCP ISNs (Initial Sequence Number) by the Linux kernel.
- can be remotely detected through observing ISNs.
- can be induced by an attacker through producing load on the victim machine.

Quote Security researcher Steven J. Murdoch
(University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) [B]

"What the Linux ISN leaks is the difference between two timestamps, not the
timestamp itself. A difference lets you work out drift and skew, which can
help someone fingerprint the computer hardware, its environment and load. Of
course that only works if you can probe a computer, and maintain the same
source/destination port and IP address."

Quote Mike Perry, developer at The Tor Project [A]:

"... it is worth complaining to the kernel developers for the simple
reason that adding the 64ns timer post-hash probably *does* leak side channels
about CPU activity, and that may prove very dangerous for long-running
cryptographic operations (along the lines of the hot-or-not issue).
Unfortunately, someone probably needs to produce more research papers before
they will listen."

tirdad (pronounce /tērdäd/) is a kernel module to hot-patch the Linux kernel
to generate random TCP Initial Sequence Numbers for IPv4 TCP connections.

You can refer to this bog post to get familiar with the original issue:

This metapackage depends on tirdad-dkms.
